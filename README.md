# Lexical-Analysis-and-Parser-for-the-language-AWK
Interpret source code in AWK by lexically analyzing text into tokens and parsing into Java actions. Made in Java.

## Features

- **Convert Text to Tokens**: Scans through AWK source files and converts the text into various token types, including Numbers, String Literals, Identifiers (Words), Symbols, and Regular Expression Patterns.
- **Polymorphism and Abstraction**: Utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with polymorphic nodes that represent different AWK constructs, such as IF blocks, assignments, and loops.
- **Recursive Descent Parsing**: Implements a recursive descent parsing technique to process tokens efficiently, allowing for hierarchical and structured code generation from AWK statements.

## Component Descriptions
#### Source Code
This is the raw AWK code that the user inputs into the system. It consists of various AWK statements, including loops, conditionals, assignments, and pattern-matching expressions.
#### Lexer
The lexer is responsible for scanning the input AWK source code and breaking it down into individual tokens. Each token represents a meaningful element in the code, such as numbers, operators, keywords, or string literals. It acts as the first step in translating the AWK code, handling the conversion from raw text to structured tokens.
#### Tokens
These are the individual units of meaning extracted by the lexer. Tokens represent language constructs like variables, operators (=, +, etc.), keywords (e.g., if, else), and literals (e.g., strings, numbers). The lexer generates a stream of tokens, which are then passed to the parser for further processing.
#### Parser
The parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and organizes them into a structured form, specifically building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The parser ensures that the token sequence follows the syntactic rules of the AWK language and applies recursive descent parsing to handle the hierarchical structure of the language.
#### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
The AST represents the structure of the AWK code in a hierarchical, tree-like form, where each node corresponds to a specific construct or operation in the code. Examples of nodes include NumberNode, IfNode, and AssignmentNode. The AST facilitates the translation from AWK syntax to executable Java actions by organizing code into discrete, manipulable units.
#### Java Actions
Once the AST is constructed, the tree is interpreted or transformed into Java actions. These actions represent the execution of the AWK code, where each node in the AST translates into specific operations or instructions within a Java program. For instance, AWK has a BEGIN Block, much like Java's Main. A Function is its own block which is called everytime the function is called within AWK.

## Future Work
Currently the program only parses AWK syntax into a Java AST. An Interpreter will be made in the future to interpret this into Java executables.
